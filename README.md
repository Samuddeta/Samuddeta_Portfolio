## [Project 1: Breast Cancer Prediction Using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Samuddeta/Breast-Cancer-Prediction.git)
## Problem Statement 
* To detect the type of a cancer from the given data, From this we can detect whether the patient is in the malignant or benign stage.
* It is based on the supervised Machine learning algorithm called logistic regression by converting the given data into binary classification. In this project developed a mechanism to test the trained data with the present data to detect the type of cancer. 

## Code and Resource used 
* Python version 3.7 
* Packages:Pandas,numpy,scikitlearn 

## Attributes 
* ID number Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 
* Radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) 
* Texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) 
* Perimeter
* Area

## Data Handling 
* Importing Libraries 
* Loading dataset 
* Data Preprocessing 
* Traning The Logistic Regression model on dataset 
* Detecting whether patient has benign or malignant stage

## Conclusion 
* Depending on dataset provided it will detect cancer stage.
* In the provided data set it will detect the patient is in malignant stage.


## [Project 2:Spam Mail Classification Using SVM](https://github.com/Samuddeta/Spam-ham-mail-prediction.git) 
# Problem Statement 
 * Predction on Spam Mail using Support vector machine algorithm, In spam mail detection email data is collected through the dataset. 
 * Pre-processing of data is done by using TF-IDF Vectorizer module. SVM algorithm is used to detect the given email is spam or ham.
 
# Attributes 
 * ID number 
 * Features
  
# Data Handling 
 * Importing Libraries 
 * Loading dataset 
 * Data Preprocessing Train -Test split 
 * Feature Extraction 
 * Training the model:> Support Vector Machine 
 * Evaluation of the model
 *  Prediction on new mail
 
 # Conclusion 
 * Depending on dataset provided it will Predict the email feature 
 * In the provided data set it is predicted spam mail and ham mail


# [Project 3:Prediction Using Linear Regression]( https://github.com/Samuddeta/prediction-of-supervised-ML.git)
# Problem Statement 
* Predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hour

## Code and Resource used 
* Python version 3.7 
* Packages:Pandas,numpy,scikitlearn,Matplotlib 

# Attributes 
 * Hours 
 * Scores
 
# Data Handling 
 * Importing Libraries 
 * Loading dataset 
 * Preparing the data
 * Training the Algorithm
 * Making Predictions
 * Evaluation of the model
 * What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?
 
 # Conclusion 
 * We can Predict score based on number of hours student studied
 * Predcited By providing input data i.e number of hours,predicted the student score.
